# AI CLM Paralegal Assistant

An AI-powered **Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM)** system that simulates a paralegal-level contract intelligence assistant using multi-agent LLM architecture, RAG, OCR, legal reasoning, fraud detection, bias analysis, and explainable decision support.

---

## Overview

Contracts are long, complex, and legally risky.
This system helps users:

* Upload **PDF (text or scanned)** contracts
* Extract key clauses automatically
* Detect legal risks
* Identify fraud indicators
* Analyze fairness and bias
* Map clauses to governing statutes
* Simulate breach scenarios
* Ask follow-up questions interactively
* Get a structured final recommendation

It is designed as a **decision-support system**, not legal advice.

# Core Features

---

## Universal PDF Support (Text + Scanned)

* Supports digital PDFs
* Uses **Tesseract OCR** for scanned documents
* Automatically detects extraction method
* Designed for real-world legal workflows

---

## Clause Extraction Agent

Automatically identifies:

* Payment clauses
* Termination clauses
* Liability provisions
* Confidentiality terms
* Jurisdiction details

> “Finds important sections instantly.”

---

## Risk Analysis Agent

Detects:

* Unlimited liability
* One-sided termination
* Missing protections
* High financial exposure
* Structural weaknesses

> “Highlights where the contract may hurt you.”

---

##  Legal Intelligence & Statute Mapper

* Identifies applicable laws
* Maps clauses to statutes
* Explains enforceability
* Flags legally weak provisions
* Explains when statutes may override clauses

> “Explains whether the contract would hold up in court.”

---

##  Fraud Risk Indicator Engine

Analyzes for:

* Fraudulent misrepresentation
* Deceptive terms
* Power imbalance exploitation
* Non-disclosure risks
* Hidden manipulation risks

> “Checks if someone could trick you using hidden wording.”

---

##  Bias Meter (Fairness Analyzer)

Determines:

* Client-favored
* Vendor-favored
* Balanced

Provides reasoning and fairness insights.

> “Tells you if the contract is tilted toward one party.”

---

##  Loophole Detector / Stress Test

Simulates:

* Vendor breach scenario
* Client breach scenario

Evaluates:

* Who is protected
* Who is vulnerable
* Likely legal outcome

> “Imagines what happens if things go wrong.”

---

##  Compliance Gap Analyzer

Identifies:

* Missing dispute resolution clauses
* Lack of reciprocal rights
* Regulatory gaps
* Incomplete protections

> “Finds what’s missing, not just what’s written.”

---

##  RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

* Splits contracts into chunks
* Generates embeddings using Gemini
* Stores vectors in ChromaDB
* Retrieves only relevant sections during Q&A

Benefits:

* Reduces hallucination
* Handles long contracts
* Improves accuracy

---

##  Session Memory

* Remembers user identity (e.g., name)
* Maintains conversational context
* Supports interactive Q&A
* Session-based (no permanent storage)

---

##  Final Recommendation Engine

Aggregates outputs from all agents and produces:

* Overall Risk Level
* Legal Stability Assessment
* Fairness Evaluation
* Structured Final Recommendation:

  * Accept
  * Review Before Signing
  * Reject
* Clear reasoning and next steps

> Acts like a senior paralegal decision assistant.
